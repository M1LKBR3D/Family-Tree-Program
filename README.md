# Family-Tree-Program
The Family Tree Program is a C++ console application that allows users to build, manage, and explore family relationships through a simple, interactive menu system. It lets you create individuals, assign their relationships, and automatically maintain the structure of the entire family tree.

The program supports adding parents, children, siblings, and spouses, and ensures that every connection is consistently linked across the tree. All family members are stored and updated dynamically, and the relationships adjust automatically as new people and connections are added.

A key feature of this project is its ASCII-based tree visualization, which displays the full family hierarchy in a clean and readable format. This makes it easy to see generations, branches, and how different people are connected.

In addition to building the tree, the program includes an illegal relationship detection system. It automatically checks for and reports biologically or socially invalid relationships such as:

- Parent–child marriages
- Sibling marriages
- Aunt/uncle with niece/nephew
- Descendant–ancestor relationships
- Minor–adult marriages
- Children born from sibling parents (inbreeding)

The program also includes a detailed information lookup feature, allowing you to view a person’s parents, spouse, children, siblings, and even grandchildren. Existing individuals can be edited at any time, and the relationships update accordingly.

Overall, this project serves as a practical demonstration of data structures, graph logic, pointer-based relationships, recursion, and user-interface design.
